In this repository one will find many wonderous things, each with the necessary files to run said things.
If the program is not meant to simply be run (One does simply run into Python) then it will have a README of its own to
help lead the user along their way to successfully running my code.
All code is provided without license (for now) and is completely rip-offable and redistributable.
