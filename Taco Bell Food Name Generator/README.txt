README for Daniel Bishop's Automatic Taco Bell Food Name Maker

This project is unofficial and Taco Bell and any inadvertent Taco Bell
food names created therein are property of Taco Bell.
This project is, hopefully, considered Fair Use under US law.
Taco Bell, please don't sue the pants off of me, this was literally the first
Python project I ever made outside of a class assignment for fun.

To anyone else: either unzip the .zip file or copy all of the other files
to a directory and run tacobellnamer (python tacobellnamer) for some
entertaining Taco Bell-esque food names.

This project was last modified September of 2010. It, as stated above,
was the first non-school project I ever did in Python. It was created
by me manually taking every existing Taco Bell foodstuff off of their
website and manually separating out at syllable boundaries. The
program mashes together prefix words (like 2-layer) and syllables to make
such words as the "Taco Bell Hard Grilled Tostipa".
