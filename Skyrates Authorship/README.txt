README for Daniel Bishop's Automated Authorship Attribution project
Included in this directory are fingerprinter.py, and the partial rewrite
dubbed "The_Machine". Neither is including supporting programs nor the
corpora from which they do their comparisons but instead are the main
portions of the programs they represent. Both are included to show
the differences and similarities between two versions of a project of mine.
The main idea behind this project was the automatic detection of multiple
characters in the game Skyrates (www.skyrates.net) being played by one person.
Via some linguistically-motivated features and no prior scholarly research
into automated authorship attribution, I set out to my task.
The results were promising but far from ideal, and I may revisit this project
again someday.
