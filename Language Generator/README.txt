README for Daniel Bishop's "Language Generator" project

This project took place from February to late April of 2011.
Its purpose was to approximate the building of a human-sounding language
from scratch. A set of consonants and vowels are picked, a sonority scale
is formed, and a syllable structure is created. This is as far as I went.
Each portion is fairly reasonable except the syllable structure which was
not finished.
This project taught me a lot about Unicode and was a fun mental exercise
to go over whilst taking a class on Phonology.
It is provided without warranty or license or any support. You may steal it
as your own or look at it or print it out in enough copies to make a
paper-mache person upon whose head you place hats. Though giving credit if
you actually do something with this would be nice.
