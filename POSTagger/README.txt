README for Daniel Bishop's POS tagger
This project was done in my spare time from mid-2011 until very early January
2012. It was not assigned by school or anyone, but rather done as I wished
to see that I could make a POS tagger, and make a good one. I partially
succeeded in both regards.

This tagger is not complete. It tags known words but not unknown words.
It tags the known words rather well, but rather slowly. This is primarily
due to optimization issues that had not been yet ironed out but were known.
In this directory is a presentation that explains, more or less, how the
tagger works. So instead here I will talk about other aspects of the project.

The tagger uses Penn Treebank data in its training, and as such many of the
supporting programs and all of the training data are not provided here.
Directory information, where reasonable, has been changed in the program
hosted here as well. As an Indiana University student studying Computational
Linguistics, I had access to the PTB but have no license to redistribute it.

Only the main POS tagging program is included here as it is the "meat"
of the project. Inquiries to the nature of the project as a whole can
be directed to me at lolologist@gmail.com

This project is protected, presumably, under some sort of license granted
by working with PTB data. Any code within not relevant to the PTB falls
under no license whatsoever.

Please note that this program was considered functional but incomplete.
Vast amounts of optimization are necessary as well as the implementation
of tagging of unknown words. This project should be considered a functional
prototype at best.
